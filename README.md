Module 6 Challenge for weather analysis and accordingly vacation planning

# Note : Please note that the interative Map plots that are generated by the the VacationPy.ipyng notebook on my local machine and saved, do not appear on the github copy.
The maps were therefore saved as city_map.png and city_hotel_map.png and displayed below

## Saved copies of the Interactive Maps
