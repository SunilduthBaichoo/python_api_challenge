Module 6 Challenge for weather analysis and accordingly vacation planning

**Note** : Please note that the interative Map plots that are generated by the the VacationPy.ipyng notebook on my local machine and saved, do not appear on the github because GitHub does not support rendering interactive plots directly (such as those created with hvplot, bokeh, or plotly) in Jupyter notebooks. However, we can use nbviewer to generate a link to make the interactive map viewable when the notebook is hosted on GitHub:
Accordingly, the notebook "VacationPy.ipynb" containing interactive maps can be viewed via nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/SunilduthBaichoo/python_api_challenge/blob/main/VacationPy.ipynb)

Please also find below **Saved copies of the Interactive Maps**.
